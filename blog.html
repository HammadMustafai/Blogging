                Basic model HP laptops are typically less expensive than their competitors, but they also tend to be slower and clankier. You get what you pay for some models, with many HP laptop owners citing short battery lives and performance issues. Here are a few other disadvantages of HP laptops are:
                
                Slower, Older Processors– Most basic HP laptops only have a Core i3 processor, which can slow down its performance while multitasking.
                
                Various Performance Levels– Bogged down software with little memory space is a recipe for poor performance, especially as the laptop ages or as you multitask.
                
                Overall Shorter Battery Life– When many HP laptops are charging, they work fine. However, when unplugged, the laptops can lag. With time, the battery drains quickly, and it holds less battery between charges.
                
                Identifying Your Laptop or Computer Needs
                
                That’s the question you need to ask when looking through HP’s options. That is because you will have many options. There are options for average users, gamers, small businesses, and specialized industries. So it’s easy to get lost in the possibilities.</p>
